Rally-Man
=========
> Twentieth century games are really nice. Games nowadays are getting boring. I'm more into old school games like this one. Back then, games like these were enough for everyone. It's the same with hackers. It was better when there were few. Then, even the smallest thing left you in the history books. Now, protection is tighter everywhere. Unless you do something really big, no one will know you. That's why I am grateful towards you, seriously. I always wanted to... try being a terrorist.
